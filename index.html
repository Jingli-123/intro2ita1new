				My name is Jing Li, I came from China and live in Melbourne about 10 years. I work in Education field already 20 years. 10 years in secondary school and taught science in China, 3 years in language school and taught Mandarin in Melbourne, 7 years in long day care service. I grew up in China and decided to move to Australia as I wanted to know the new world.
				I interested in Sci-fi, read a lot of Sci-fi novel, such as “Sundiver” by David Brin, “A Fire Upon the Deep” by Vernor Vinge, “Old Man’s War” by John Scalzi, etc.
				Also, I love Sci-fi movie. Love both of “Star War” and “Star Trek”, they both good in my opinion.
				I interested in video and PC game, played “StarCraft”, “Sims 3”, “Sims4” and some Chinese video game, for example, “Sword and Fairy” series.But now I have not more time to play game as I am spending a lot of time to study. I enjoy painting sometimes and try new food with family. I would like to change my career to explore the new things after 20 years work in education area. I will work as hard as I can to achieve this new goal.
