				Honey and Mumford learning Types Test
			</h1>

				The four different ways in which people prefer to learn that Honey and Mumford have identified, relate to a different stage in the learning cycle. These are Activist, Reflector, Theorist and Pragmatist. In this model Mumford and Honey describe the learning styles as a continuum that one moves through over time (The Dpartment of Health and Aged Care, 2004).

			You learn better in structured learning activities which follow a logical sequence. You prefer lecture, demonstrations, theory and precision teaching.

			You are great at integrating your research into complex and logically sound theories. You approach all problems through a logical process and can combine seemingly disconnected concepts into a rational scheme. You tend to be a bit of a perfectionist. You love to study from principles, theories and models. You tend to be detached, analytical and rational and don't like ambiguity or subjectivity.
